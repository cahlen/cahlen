# üëã Hi, I'm Cahlen Humphreys!

## üöÄ **Featured Project**
### [Conversation Dataset Generator](https://cahlen.github.io/conversation-dataset-generator/)
A cutting-edge tool to simplify and accelerate the creation of conversation datasets for AI models. Whether you're working on chatbots, sentiment analysis, or dialogue systems, this project will help you generate high-quality datasets with ease. Check it out and let me know what you think!

yo! My name is Cahlen. Here are the basics: I live in SoCal, I'm 42 years old (still weird to me), I have a wife and a kid (grown-up kid!), and I spend every waking moment of my life either with my wife riding motorcycles or working on AI projects and future architectures. Sometimes I actually just draw out crazy architectures on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) because they make it so simple. 

I've been in computing ever since I can remember. My first computer was a Tandy that my dad brought home in the late 80s. So, I sort of grew up with the evolution of personal computing, which I think selfishly gives me quite a leg up in certain areas. 

I used to hang out on EFnet in the late 90s and early 00s quite a bit, and made quite a few good friends. That is where my interest in software engineering really began.

For a long story short, I went to Boise State University (undergrad in mathematics) and Florida Atlantic University (graduate in mathematics), and I had a great time at both. When you're that young, you don't realize how valuable that free time you have to study is. You'd think it would increase the older you get, but it shrinks. So, take your time studying! Math is your friend!

What do I do currently? I manage a company called [Enfuse.io](https://enfuse.io). We're a services company that works on really interesting software projects. We began in the big data era, teaching companies how to build massive smart platforms and data pipelines to store their data over time, promising them it would pay off when AI became practical.

... Well, AI is practical now. Even the home consumer can run an AI model on their own computer (still wild to me). And what I felt when I was young‚Äîthe wonder of Linux just beginning, the transition from Bulletin Board Systems to the World Wide Web, the massive increase in computer performance, the dot-com era‚Äîit was all a magical time. I truly do feel like the time we're at now mirrors those days. I see the marriage of AI and web3 in my brain, which seems like an inevitability... we're in for a very exciting time.

My advice? Don't be scared of the math. Embrace it. It makes you better, more logical, more precise, more thoughtful. Even if you just speedran your CS degree, hit the books a little bit with some linear algebra. Take a few deep learning courses. You *truly* don't know what you're missing out on.

## üöÄ About Me
- **Current Role**: Managing Principal at Enfuse.io
- **Expertise**: AI Software Engineering, Edge AI, LLMs, Computer Vision, Distributed Systems, and Real-Time Analytics.
